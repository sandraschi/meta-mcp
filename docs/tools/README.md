### [Tool Execution](tool-execution.md)
Remote invocation engine: execute tools across connected MCP servers with parameter validation and history tracking.

### [Repository Intelligence](repository-intelligence.md)
Deep codebase analysis: health scoring, dependency auditing, code quality metrics, and structure analysis.

### [Client Management](client-management.md)
Multi-IDE ecosystem control: manage configurations for Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, and Antigravity with backup safety.

### [Diagnostics](diagnostics.md)
System health and safety: Unicode crash prevention (EmojiBuster), PowerShell validation, and crash protection.
